# NLPARG

Natural Language Processing for Antimicrobial resistance genes software was developed to predict antimicrobil resistance genes. Three neural embedding models, Global vectors (GloVe), skip-gram (Sg) and Continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW) were used as embedding layersin recurrent neural networks. Users have the option of using any of the three three neural layers used in the models for prediction.
